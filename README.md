# UHF-23Na
MATLAB script for post-processing of 23Na imaging at UHF platform

# Protocol
1 Intensity correction
    Low resolution (LR) acquisition with short TR and different receiving coil setting
        LR with array coil (NAA)
        LR with volume coil (NAV)
        LR with array coil (NAA)

2 High resolution 23Na imaging
    High resolution (HR) acquisition with long TR (120ms) and 90 degree flip angle.
