## Protocol
1. Intensity correction <br />
Low resolution (LR) acquisition with short TR and different receiving coil setting <br />
LR with array coil (NAA) <br />
LR with volume coil (NAV) <br />
LR with array coil (NAA) <br />

2. High resolution 23Na imaging <br />
High resolution (HR) acquisition with long TR (120ms) and 90 degree flip angle. <br />
